# License-Plate-Recognition
In this study, a license plate recognition system was developed using image processing techniques. Unlike previous studies, all algorithms have been rewritten in the software using C # programming language instead of ready systems. Tesseract is used to read the plates in this software. When the license plate recognition results were examined, it was confirmed by the applications that the plates were improved in reading speed and accuracy rates. The correct reading of the plates with 88.1%, with 98% success, supports this situation. 
The study has been kept open to improvement, as it is in a position to perform basic image processing techniques. In subsequent studies, the success rate in character recognition and general success rates can be increased by using artificial intelligence methods in reading characters.
