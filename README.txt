# License-Plate-Recognition
In this study, a license plate recognition system was developed using image processing techniques. Unlike previous studies, all algorithms (Grayscale, Binary, Median, Thresholding, Sobell Edge Detection, Find Plaque, Crop Plaque) have been rewritten in software using C# programming language instead of ready-made libraries. Tesseract OCR is used in this software to read the characters present on the plate. When the license plate recognition results were examined, it was confirmed with the applications that the reading speed and accuracy rates of the license plates were improved. The correct reading of the plates with 88.1% supports this situation with a success rate of 98%.
My work has been kept open for improvement as it is in a position to apply basic image processing techniques. In the case of advancing the project, the success rate and overall success rates in character recognition can be increased by using artificial intelligence methods in character reading.
